### How to print to the console

When you code, one of the most important things is to know, at various steps in your code, what you are actually coding. Sometimes you need to fin out immediately, that a particular block of code, or even a line for that matter, runs the exact way you intende for it to work. Imagine writing hundreds or thousands lines of code with no way of finding out what your code does.

This is where ```console.log()``` comes in. It is a fundamental method in JavaScript that allows you to output information to the console. This is particularly useful for debugging, tracking the flow of your code, and inspecting the values of variables during program execution.

You can use it in your code to simply print a message```console.log("Hello, World!");```, a variable(s)```var name = "Jay"; console.log(name);```, an object, an array, a function call and so on.

You can see the output in a web browser by:
1. Opening the browser (works best in Mozilla Firefox).
2. Opening the developer tools by simply pressing `F12`.
3. Going to the "Console" tab.

You can also view the output from node.js application so long you have it installed on your computer.

Some of the uses of this tool are:
1. Debugging
2. Tracking code flow
3. Testing and verification
4. Inspecting data
5. Error Tracking
6. Real-time feedback

These are just some of the uses and if you're going to be a javascript developer, "console.log()" is going to be your friend.

On a final note, remember to remove "console.log()" calls from your production code after use to avoid unnecessary output and potential security risk.
