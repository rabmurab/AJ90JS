### Intro

I recently came across a post from Ajay Yadav on Twitter/X, urging anyone who think has what it takes to take on a chellenge.

The challenge was to go on a 90-day journey of coding in JavaScript.

I decided to take on the challenge not only because I know I have it in me, but also to have a community of js programmers to go on an adventure with.

It should be noted however, this is not the firt time I'm learning js. I believe the earlier part of the challenge is going to come relatively easy for me.

The first 5 days of the challenge is as follows:
1. About JavaScript.
2. Its uses and role in web development.
3. Set up the development environment with a code editor.
4. Write first "Hello World" programs.

So, let's dive in..

#### About JavaScript

JavaScript or js is one of, if not, the most popular programming language there is out there. Js, along with HTML and CSS, form the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 

#### JavaScript and Web Development

When it comes to web development, js has no competion. It is hands down the most used language in this space and it's popularity is only getting higher by the day. This is largely because of its simplicity and flexibility, but what sets its apart from every other language is its ability to manipilate the DOM and how easily it does that.

#### My development environment has been set in Virtual Studio Code (VS Code).

#### My (not) First "Hello World" program

var firstCode = "Hello World";
console.log(firstCode);
